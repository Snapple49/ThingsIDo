    <!-- The dictype declares what document type this will be, "!doctype html" being HTML5.
     I will be using HTML5 as I generally like to use the latest versions and I also make use of some of the new features in HTML5 like sections, header and footer, and also some
     of the attributes and logic. I would argue it makes more semantic sense than older versions on a lot of the elements and attributes, there are more specific elements to mark
     up your text with. Since it's also a standard now, I don't see why I shouldn't use it, even though there might be a small portion of potential users that might not use browsers
     that support HTML5 fully. Some of the new features in HTML5 will still be interpreted as a more generic version in older standards anyway, like the new input types in forms.
     These default to the text input if the browser doesn't support the new types, so this should not be much of a problem. -->

                <p>
                This is a personal portfolio of sorts, where I will post and talk about projects of all
                kinds that I have done or that I'm currently working with. I like to dabble in a lot of things
                so you can expect a little bit of everything. The kind of things I'll be uploading are <b>music</b>,    
                <b>paintings and drawings</b> I've made, <b>photos</b> I've taken, various <b>building projects</b> I've done like instruments
                and handcrafty stuff, and <b>digital projects</b> like programming and game projects, Raspberry Pi or
                Ardunio projects and more that I have worked with. I hope you will find something interesting or inspiring!
