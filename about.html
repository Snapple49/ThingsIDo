                <p id="aboutMe">So my name is Oliver Stein. Currently, I'm a student of the Master Programme in Computer and Information Engineering at Uppsala University, Sweden, with 3 more years of studies. I enjoy technological
                stuff and gadgets, but I also love design, art and nature, hence why I dabble in a bit of everything. I love animals and I enjoy outdoor activities
                like hikes, fishing, camping, while I also like spending hours in front of my computer doing "useless stuff" like games or surfing the web. When I have
                time, usually in the summer, I try to do as many projects as I can like building instruments or painting, photographing or recording music. And now
                I'm managing this website. I do get up to a lot of things! I actively try to increase efficiency by creating multiple copies of myself, as seen on some of these photos.
                It's about the only way I can think of to have time to do all these things!</p>

                <p>This site is a project from a course in web design, which I decided I could use to create a site to share my works
                that I like enough to share. Unless I explicitly say so, all the work I publish is my own creations. Exceptions
                might be covers of other musicians' songs or using reference photos/tracing, but then I will give
                credit where credit is due. Any owner of intellectual property I refer to or have used is free and welcome to tell me to
                remove content if they feel infringed, I respect ownership and will comply. Please note I do not sell anything or make money
                from this, the site is purely for me to share things I do with the world.</p>
